# Stereo Vision Triangulation

Notes on stereo vision triangulation where different strategies to perform structure estimation with a stereo-vision system are discussed. Theory and examples using a dataset are used in this notebook. Additionally, a special case of triangulation in structure light systems is also considered. Nbextensions was used in the notebook.
